The Youtube Wayback Scraper is an Windows app for the yt-dlp fork that enables the retrieval of deleted/privated Youtube videos, if they are present on the Wayback Machine.

Using the app is pretty straight forward.

- Choose the directory that you would like the downloaded videos to be saved to.

- Enter the url or ID of a unavailable YouTube video, or a YouTube playlist that contains unavailable videos. You can also list multiple urls and/or IDs in the search bar, separated by commas(,).

- Alternatively, you can click the upload button and upload a .txt file with a list of urls and/or IDS (one per line).

- The user may switch between video or audio only using the designated box. Select the video quality or file type with the respective boxes, or retrieve the default video type by leaving them unaltered.

- You may either save all of the found videos instantly by checking the designated box, or you can choose which videos you would like to keep. Hit submit, and wait for the command prompts to finish processing. 

- If you did not check the box, the names and IDs of the videos that are found will be displayed in the box. You can select the ones you want or download them all.

- Your downloaded videos will be stored in the folder you chose.

- That's it! You're done!
